# dropship-update-code

This repo is used to update various liquid codes on my updated Dawn theme, which aligns with "The Dropship in 21 Days" theme that is outdated.

First code commit has the original Dawn theme .liquid code file, 2nd commit has the updates to that same .liquid code file. That's basically what this repo is about -- knowing what got updated to the original .liquid file.
