# Dawn Dropship Theme

Use this theme when creating new 6-figure dropshipping stores. 

Inspired by Ricky Amador's [Dropship in 21 Days][1] course, but this theme is updated with the latest version of Shopify's Dawn's theme.

## Here's how to use it:

1. [Download our Dropship Shopify theme (.zip file)][2] into your computer. To do so, click the link, and then click the "down arrow" on the top of the screen -- which allows you to download the zip file.
2. In your Shopify Dashboard, go to `Online Store`.
3. Near the top-right, look for `Import theme`, then click `Upload zip`. Add the zip file you just downloaded.
4. If you're ready to publish, click `Publish` to publish the theme.

And that's it.

## Some notes:

* This theme adds to the free `Dawn` theme Shopify provides, including these new custom sections:
    * `as-seen-on-logos.liquid`
    * `flickity-ugc-slider.liquid` ([source][3])
    * `gallery-tabs` ([source][4])
    * `image-slider.liquid`
    * `testimonials.liquid`
    * `video.liquid` (upgraded [source][5])

* And here are some custom css/js files:
    * `zendrop.css`
    * `powerups.css`
    * `powerups-mobile.css`

There are a few others, but the ones mentioned are the main ones.

In all, simply [download our Dropship theme's zip file][2], and you're ready to go. All of the custom sections and their settings are already there. You just need to fill in the blanks on each section to suit your brand's audience.

> Final note: If you want even more custom sections, like a categorized picture gallery, or a video when people first view your homepage, [check out our custom power-ups][6] you can add after getting some sales.
